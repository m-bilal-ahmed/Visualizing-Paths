# Visualizing-Paths

This is an interactive pathfinding visualizer built with **React** and **JavaScript**, showcasing classic algorithms like **Dijkstra’s** in a grid-based environment. Users can set start/end points, add walls, and watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real time.

This project reflects my interest in spatial computing and routing logic — areas I’m excited to explore professionally.
